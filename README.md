# EaglerList
We converted Eaglercraft into a Scratch list and all you need to do is export it and rename it to "game.html"!
To install, check releases

# Editions
Currently, only Turbowarp & PenguinMOD are supported and it won't run on Scratch due to the lack of advanced extensions!
Although we are compiling a version for Scratch that will release soon, wait for v1.0!
